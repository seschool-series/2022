                            <strong>Productivity of Software Engineers while Working From Home during the Pandemic and Beyond </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Working from home (WFH) or telework is something that until COVID-19 has been known only as a voluntary and often exceptional practice in the workplace. On one hand, telework is often associated with
                            the perceived increase of productivity and job satisfaction (mostly self-reported by teleworkers), and on the other hand, with a great managerial issue and a loss of control (as reported by the managers). Many managers before
                            and today are skeptical because they question the ability of their staff to handle remote infrastructure, solve any situation independently, manage their time properly or work without supervision. But is telework really a problem?
                            In this tutorial, we will discuss evidence from thirteen surveys of perceived productivity and dive into a detailed analysis of one company’s commit data, calendar invitations and Slack communication, among other things, to
                            better understand how software engineers continue working, what their routines and work patterns are, and what (if at all) the differences from the office times are. Distributed work is surely not challenge-free, but there
                            is a clear group of developers who highly benefit from it. Finally, we will conclude with the insights into employee preferences for the future and the new work policies in several Scandinavian companies. Work from home is
                            here to stay, so how are you prepared for the future?

                            University of Innsbruck, Austria. She has received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Innsbruck, Austria (2019) and her Master’s degree in Information Systems from the University of Münster, Germany
                            (2012). Her research interests span empirical and theoretical perspectives on security, privacy, digital currencies, and payment systems, with a strong focus on economic, human, behavioural, and social aspects. She is particularly
                            interested in interdisciplinary and multi-method research, at the frontier between computer science, information systems, economics, and the social sciences. Svetlana regularly serves as an Associate Editor and PC member at
                            the renowned International and European Conferences on Information Systems (ICIS, ECIS) and the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS). Prior to her Ph.D. studies, she worked as a senior IT consultant in a
                            management consultancy in Germany.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Game theory, the study of conflict situations and strategic decision making, has proved to be a valuable tool in economics, social and political sciences, evolutionary biology, psychology, or computer
                            science. The fundamental concepts, supported by proven mathematics, make game-theoretical approaches of interest in many cyber security and privacy research problems, too. Besides the most obvious attacker-defender scenario,
                            game theory can be applied to study economic incentives in such real-world examples as interdependent security or privacy, collaborative anonymity, or mandatory breach reporting. This session will introduce the basic notions,
                            elements, and solution concepts of game theory, supported by selected canonical games and examples from information security and privacy. In the second part, students will apply the learned game-theoretical apparatus, model
                            a given security problem as a game in group work, and discuss the strengths as well as limitations of game theory.

                            in Lero – the Irish Software Research Centre in Limerick, Ireland. Her primary research interests are in socio-technical aspects of software engineering like software engineer motivation, agile methods, distributed software
                            development, and the impact of technology on the lives of the older adult. She is involved in two Science Foundation (SFI) funded projects. The Global Agile project that focus on rolling out the scaled agile framework (SAFe)
                            and the Smart Ageing project that researches how technology can support the older adult.
